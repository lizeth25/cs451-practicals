"""
In this lab, we'll go ahead and use the sklearn API to compare some real models over real data!
Same data as last time, for now.

Documentation:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html

We'll need to install sklearn, and numpy.
Use pip:

    # install everything from the requirements file.
    pip install -r requirements.txt
